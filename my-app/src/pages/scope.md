**Scope Document: Earthscan SaaS Front-End Prototype**

**Objective:**
Create a clickable, front-end-only prototype of the Earthscan platform using React + Tailwind (or preferred stack) in Cursor. This prototype should visualize the user's journey from onboarding through data analysis results, incorporating placeholder content and navigation.
